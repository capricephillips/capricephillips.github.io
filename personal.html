								<h3>Mini Bio</h3>
								<p> I was born and raised in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Hot Springs is a southern small city that hosts Hot Springs National Park, which is famous for the naturally occurring geothermal springs and  historic bathhouses. For my love of astronomy, I have to thank my mother. She was the first person to see an astronomer in me, even when I did not know what it was. We would take trips to my grandparents house in rural Arkansas when I was young and my mother noticed I would stare at the moon and stars. She encouraged me to pursue astronomy, she would take me to the library to check out astronomy books and let me watch <i> How the Universe Works</i>, when we had free channel previews on some weekends. I even wrote in my 8th grade yearbook that I hoped my career would be an astronomer! My mom always encouraged me to pursue education and astronomy; I am forever grateful for her and the time we had together.
								</p>
								<p>
								For my undergraduate degree, I attended the University of Arkansas at Little Rock at Little Rock (UALR),
								 Arkansas where I was a Ronald E. McNair Scholar. <a href="https://mcnairscholars.com/about/"> The McNair Scholars Program </a> introduced me to the realm of research and to the possibility of obtaining a PhD. My first few research projects were as a McNair scholar; I researched meteorites and Earth as a Transiting Exoplanet. During my senior year I received the Outstanding Senior Award from the McNair Program at UALR. During undergraduate, I had a chance to engage with science education as an educator at the Museum of Discovery in Little Rock, Arkansas; which sparked my interest in educational work.  
								 <p>
								  When I am not working on research, I am enjoying getting back into reading, crafting (coloring, watercoloring, painting flower pots), cooking, and trying my hand at new recipes. <i> Try to find the hidden pages on my website with some of these images!</i> I am also obsessed with Pinterest. 
					  I enjoy attending comic conventions to let out my inner nerd. I am passionate about social justice along with equity & inclusion work in astronomy and STEM in general.<p>

								<h3>Exploring Nature through National Parks and State Parks</h3>
								<p> Over the past few years, I have had the opportunity to work as a Night Skies Assistant
								in the National Park Service through the  <a href="https://www.mosaicsinscience.org"> Mosaics in Science Internship Program </a>. In 2016, I worked at Sleeping Bear Dunes National 
								Lakeshore in Empire, Michigan. At Sleeping Bear Dunes, I worked with park staff to provide a detailed documentation of the lighting inventory as the park prepared to apply to become a Dark Sky Park. I also developed astronomy activities for their Inaugural Astronomy 
								Day and  collected measurements of the quality of the night sky. </p>

								<p> In 2019, I also worked as a Night Skies Assistant at Sequoia National Park in Three Rivers, California. I lived in the Mineral King area of the park, which you can access after a 20 mile scenic drive up a winding mountain where you arrive at a destination 7500  feet above sea level. Mineral King  is a very quaint area with no cell service
								and  minimal sound and light pollution. I witnessed some of the most astonishing clear night skies there!
								I created and implemented the first astronomy evening program for the remote Mineral King area  and developed a mobile interpretation station that included topics concerning light pollution and night skies.</p>
